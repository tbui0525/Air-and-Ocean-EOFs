# Air-and-Ocean-EOFs

The following files will reproduce the figures and results from Calculation, Visualization, and Interpretation of 3D Air-Ocean Coupled Empirically Orthogonal Functions

Below is a description of each of the following folders and their contents:

- 3D Figures: This folder contains multiple downloadable HTML files that visualize the following in 3D:
  - January Climatology : The arithmetic temperature mean for each data point over time.
  - January Standard Deviation: The standard deviation for each data point over time
  - January EOF1: The first mode of the air-ocean coupled general model visualized in 3D
  - January EOF2: The second mode of the air-ocean coupled general model visualized in 3D
  - Air Only January EOF1: The first mode of the air-only model (20CRV3) visualized in 3D
  - Air Only January EOF2: The second mode of the air-only model (20CRV3) visualized in 3D
 The HTML files are interactive, allowing the user to zoom, pan, and rotate the figure to have a fuller view of the data.
- data: This file has a link to a Dropbox folder which contains the following data used in the computations and visualizations. Download the following files and place them into a folder named data for computations
